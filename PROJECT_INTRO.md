# 🚀 AI Form Filler: Multi-Agent Chrome Extension

## **The Problem**
😫 **Users waste 15-30 minutes daily** filling repetitive forms with the same personal information across websites

## **Our Solution**
🤖 **Four AI Agents Working Together** to turn any web form into an intelligent, self-filling experience:

| Agent | What It Does |
|-------|--------------|
| 🧠 **Gemini** | Understands form context & generates smart values |
| 🔍 **Embedding** | Finds relevant data from your uploaded documents |
| 📄 **File Processing** | Organizes your personal documents automatically |
| 🎯 **UI Feedback** | Shows real-time status & guides the process |

## **Key Innovation**
✨ **Learn Once, Use Everywhere**: Upload your CV once → Works on all websites  
🧠 **Context-Aware**: Knows "Company" field needs employer, not your name  
🔒 **Privacy-First**: All processing happens locally on your device

## **Impact**
```
❌ Before: 30 minutes of typing per day
✅ After:  2 clicks, 10 seconds

= 120+ hours saved per year
```
